<h2 id="endgame_reports_record_growth_for_2014_adds_two_new_executives">Endgame Reports Record Growth for 2014; Adds Two New Executives</h2>

<p><em>Arlington, VA</em> – October 29, 2014 – Endgame, Inc., a leading provider of security intelligence and analytics solutions that give enterprises real-time visibility and actionable insight across their digital domains, today announced record growth for 2014. In the first three quarters of 2014, Endgame has tripled sales over 2013. Over the same time frame, the company has added 39 new employees, augmenting its expertise in data science, malware analysis, and cloud security. Endgame’s two most recent hires include Senior Vice President of Marketing Jon Brody and Vice President of Engineering Jim Tosh. Mr. Brody will lead Endgame’s marketing strategy while Mr. Tosh will lead development of Endgame’s security technology products.</p>

<p>“Both Jon and Jim have a depth of expertise in enterprise security that will be instrumental to Endgame’s growth,” said Endgame CEO Nate Fick. “By continuing to add top-tier security product and market expertise to our ranks, expanding our product offerings in the federal market, and delivering battle-tested enterprise solutions that help safeguard businesses, Endgame will continue the record growth trajectory it has demonstrated in 2014.”</p>

<p>For the past 16 years, Mr. Brody has established marketplace leaders in enterprise software, IT security and compliance; developed new growth areas in commercial technology markets; and increased revenue by as much as 400 percent. He was most recently the Vice President of Marketing at Tenable Network Security, leading the rebranding and repositioning of the company. He also held executive marketing roles at TriCipher (acquired by VMware) and Sygate Technologies (acquired by Symantec).</p>

<p>“I am thrilled to join Endgame at such a critical time in the enterprise security market as customers across the board seek superior solutions for defending systems and carrying out their cyber missions,” said Mr. Brody. “Endgame will continue to lead in this space as we expand our federal offerings and deliver enterprise solutions that protect customers from advanced threats.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tosh has spent the last decade leading product engineering initiatives and successfully bringing new security products and innovative technologies to market. He was most recently Head of Engineering at Authentic8, where he drove software architecture and design and built a team that rapidly brought products to reality. He previously held senior engineering positions at Juniper Networks and Redline Networks (acquired by Juniper Networks).</p>

<p>“I’m excited to lead the engineering team at Endgame, as this is an unparalleled opportunity to drive the technology growth and success of a company at the cutting-edge of security intelligence and cyber security,” said Mr. Tosh. “Building on the company’s existing innovation, I look forward to further developing our technical vision through this next phase of the company’s expansion into the enterprise market.”</p>

                    <b>Project: </b>Member Portal Mobile Application<br/><br/>
                    <b>Client: </b>A Health Services Firm

                <b>Business Case</b><br/>
                
                Our client provides patient centric approach to managing drugs and benefits. It had a Web Member Portal that allows the members to register and manage their benefits. However, the members still lacked the ability to easily access their benefits and drug information on the go, when they have no access to a computer. <br/><br/>
                
                <b>Solution</b><br/>
                
                Data Concepts worked with the client to identify the key mobile uses cases for members and helped define the Mobile product vision and strategy. The primary objective was to deliver the functionality needed for a member from a mobile device and to add contextual information from mobile such as location awareness to improve the services delivered on the Mobile App.<br/><br/>
                
                The Member Portal Mobile App allows the member users obtain drug pricing information, find alternate generic medications, locate a nearby in-network pharmacy, view the claims history and manage their benefits. The mobile app is also integrated with the device phone app, GPS and the device map. <br/><br/>
                
                The Mobile App is built using cross-platform mobile application framework – PhoneGap and targets the iOS, Android smartphones and tablets. By using PhoneGap, Data Concepts was able to ensure maximum ode reusability without having to maintain multiple code bases and teams for each Mobile operating system.</br></br>

                 Data Concepts developed a solution that consisted of an SQL Server database into which the data has been migrated from Virginia Department of Conservation & Recreation’s [DCR] existing MS Access application.  The data model was redesigned to be more optimal and less rudimentary as compared to the original Access database.The solution comprised of about 20 pre-defined Reports; about 20 ad-hoc Reports; Web Form implemented in ASP.Net for DCR to be able to enter data into the new system and a Role-based User Access Control Form.   Additionally, the solution included automated scripts for importing data from Commonwealth Accounting and Reporting System (CARS); two ‘comma separated’ export files containing aggregated daily history and weekly checks written information for import into IDSS; and a reconciliation report that identifies discrepancies in daily financial transactions between DCR’s accounts payable system (IDSS) and related CARS download.  The tools & technologies used to implement the solution included SQL Server 2008, .Net Framework 4.0, ASP.Net 4.0, C#, Visual Studio 2010, IIS 7.0, Window Server 2008 and as SQL Server Reporting Services [SSRS].

        <div><p>
            The administration of the Commonwealth of Virginia’s statewide Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program [MVIP] is the responsibility of Virginia State Police. As of December 31, 2007, there were 4,388 active inspection stations located throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.  There were over 14,000 licensed safety inspectors who performed approximately 8,000,000 inspections at appointed stations during 2007. Approximately 25% of all vehicles submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components.<br/><br/>
            
            This program was a manual and laborious process which results in data discrepancy and slow processes. Data Concepts was awarded the entire contract to build a new Web Based Application to automate and re-engineer entirely the current labor intensive and error prone process. Data Concepts successfully managed, staffed, executed and delivered into production this system for VSP.<br/><br/>
            
            The new MVIP web application will automate the complete Inspection Safety Program. <br/><br/>
            
            The new MVIP Web Application has the following technical features:
            <ul>
                <li>Approximately 30-50 Views / Web pages</li>
                <li>View customization based on Roles and Group</li>
                <li>Web 2.0</li>
                <li>Section 508 Compliant</li>
                <li>Follows Virginia Information Technology Agency [VITA] Architecture Guidelines</li>
                <li>Designed to handle around one million plus transactions a month</li>
                <li>Designed to handle approx 4000+ station users</li>
            </ul>
            
            This development & deployment of this system was a huge endeavor & initiative by VSP to radically improve the efficiency and productivity of the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspections and involves major Business Process Re-engineering and automation push.  Data Concepts’ being awarded this contract is another testament of its deep technical and project management expertise & reputation in delivering large and complex projects. This was a deliverable based, fixed price project.<br/><br/>
            
            The tools & technologies used to implement the solution included Java/JEE, Spring, Struts, Ibatis, EJB, MDB, Jquery, JSON, IText, Velocity, Web Services, JAXB, Oracle 11g, SVN, Subclipse, IBM RAD, IBM Websphere

                Virginia State Police’s [VSP] existing Firearms Transaction Program provided a point-of-sale, approval or disapproval decision regarding the sale or transfer of all firearms in the state of Virginia.  VSP wanted to replace the existing application with a more scalable, extensible and robust web architecture and add major new features and functionalities including enhancements based on new laws enacted by the State General Assembly.  
                
                Data Concepts was awarded by VSP the work to completely redesign, rewrite and replace the current Firearms system in web technologies. This system developed by Data Concepts is to be used statewide by VSP personnel, firearm dealers and sellers.  Every firearm sold or bought in the Commonwealth of Virginia is processed by this application.
